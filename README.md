# Java Game Dev
A short and sweet tutorial on how to dip your toes on some Java Gamedev :)

This tutorial book will cover the most important things on using Java to make games using the LWJGL library which has been popular since the use in Minecraft.

By the end of the tutorial, you will not just be a experienced Java gamedev who has no ideas on what to do. We will give you some projects to do, as well as samples to check out.

To start the tutorial, you just need these basics:
  1. To code java
  2. To code java
  3. To code java

YES!! You heard it right!! Just some experience in Java, like the hello world code which looks like this:
```java
class DemoClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

Currently, the book is a bit incomplete. I will finish it soon :)
Regularly check out for updates on the book.
